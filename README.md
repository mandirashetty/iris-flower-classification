## Overview  

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification problems. This project includes:  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots.  
- Building and evaluating machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree).  
- Visualizing model performance through metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.  

## Features  

- Load and clean the Iris dataset.  
- Visualize data distributions and correlations.  
- Preprocess data for machine learning.  
- Implement multiple machine learning models.  
- Evaluate and compare model performances.  
- Test new data for predictions.  

## Technologies Used  

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)  
  - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
  - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)  
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)  

## Dataset  

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:  
- **Sepal Length (cm)**  
- **Sepal Width (cm)**  
- **Petal Length (cm)**  
- **Petal Width (cm)**  
- **Species**: Target variable with three classes:  
  - Iris-setosa  
  - Iris-versicolor  
  - Iris-virginica

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git  
cd your-repo-name  
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac  
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows  
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Ensure the dataset (Iris.csv) is in the data/ directory.

Usage
Run the script:

python src/iris_analysis.py  
Modify the sample_data variable in the script to test with new inputs:


sample_data = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]  # Replace with your values  
View generated visualizations in the results/visualizations/ folder.

Results
The following models were trained and evaluated:

Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	~97%
K-Nearest Neighbors	~96%
Decision Tree	~96%
Sample Confusion Matrix

Future Work
Implement additional models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
Deploy the model as a web application.
