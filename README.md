## Overview  

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification problems. This project includes:  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots.  
- Building and evaluating machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree).  
- Visualizing model performance through metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.  

## Features  

- Load and clean the Iris dataset.  
- Visualize data distributions and correlations.  
- Preprocess data for machine learning.  
- Implement multiple machine learning models.  
- Evaluate and compare model performances.  
- Test new data for predictions.  

## Technologies Used  

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)  
  - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
  - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)  
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)  

## Dataset  

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:  
- **Sepal Length (cm)**  
- **Sepal Width (cm)**  
- **Petal Length (cm)**  
- **Petal Width (cm)**  
- **Species**: Target variable with three classes:  
  - Iris-setosa  
  - Iris-versicolor  
  - Iris-virginica  

## Results  

The implemented models achieve the following approximate accuracies:

Logistic Regression: ~97%

KNN: ~96%

Decision Tree: ~96%

The confusion matrix and classification report provide further insights into model performance.
